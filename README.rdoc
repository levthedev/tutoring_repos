to get this running locally, you'll need ruby, rails, bundler, git, and postgresql (get Postgres.app if you're on OSX)

`git clone git@github.com:levthedev/tutoring_repos.git` OR `git clone https://github.com/levthedev/tutoring_repos.git` if you don't have SSH set up for Git (which you should)

cd into the project, and run `bundle`

finally, run `rake db:create db:migrate` to create and migrate your postgresql database, and then `rails server` to spin up a a server on localhost:3000.

remember to stick a byebug anywhere for debugging (or use rails console)!
